// IMPROVEMENTS
// (DONE) add event listener scroll only on y scroll if it is possible (probably it is not possible)
// (DONE) to body width (fixed but looks like TODO)
// should we show space for input on new line (unsearchable mode check) on RESIZE (try to set width and height to 0 by default and on focus chenge styles)
// Recheck performance
// Lagging during fast scroll with append to body
// list scroll overlaps border 
// updateDisabled methods to avoid a remount
// create update function for the list to avoid a remount
// use _ instead private class #
// disable change focused element on fast scroll appendToBody
